                      1.What is Function
                  </h2>
                   A function from a set X to a set Y is an assignment of an element of Y to each element of X. The set X is called the domain of the function and the set Y is called the codomain of the function.

                      <b>1)Identity Function</b><br>
                      A Function f: A->A is set to be Identity Function,if the images of every element of A is A itself. i.e, f(a)=a where a belongs to A and a belongs to A.                        
                      <br><br>
                        <b>2)Constant Function</b><br>
			A Function f:A->B is said to be constant function if all the elements of A have the same image of B.<br><br>
<b>3)Subjective function</b><br>
A Function f:A->B is said to be on-to function if every element of B has a pre-image in A.<br><br>
                    <b>4)Injective function</b><br>
			The one-to-one function is also termed an injective function,if every element of A has a unique image in B and every element of f(a) has unique pre-image in A.<br><br>
			 <b>5)Bijective Function</b><br>
			A Function f:A->B is said to be bijective if it is both one-to-one and on-to function.<br>

                <h1><b>APPLICATIONS OF FUNCTIONS</b></h1>
			<br>
			In mathematics, function application is the act of applying a function to an argument from its domain so as to obtain the corresponding value from its range. In this sense, function application can be thought of as the opposite of function abstraction.<br><br>
                <p><h2>1.ATM:</h2> <br>
 <img class="img1"style="border: 5px solid black;"src="C:\Users\91968\Desktop\maths webpage\atm.jpeg" width="200px"/>
<br><br>
When the ATM card is inserted to the machine,the program inside is performing a function to map the number stored in the card to your current or saving account.This is basically a one-to-one mapping,i.e.,function.This is probably the most widely and popular use of function<br><br></p>

<h2>2.Vending Machine: </h2><br>
 <img class="img1"style="border: 5px solid black;"src="C:\Users\91968\Desktop\maths webpage\vending.jpeg" width="200px"/><br><br>
A vending machine is an automated device designed to offer customers a wide variety of goods, including snacks, beverages, cupcakes, newspapers, tickets, and more. Depending on the amount of money inserted and the product chosen, a vending machine will dispense a product to the users. The money and the chosen button serve as the input, and the products received serve as the output.<br><br>

<br>
<b>Remuneration:</b> <br>
		The hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked determine a personâ€™s weekly or monthly salary.<br><br>
<b>Taxes and tax brackets:</b> <br>
Another typical example of a function is the tax bracket. We can better understand the relationship between tax and taxable income by calculating the tax on a variety of different taxable incomes using functions.<br><br>
<b>Market value:</b> <br>
When an input value crosses predetermined boundaries, a rule, or relationship changes, and we use functions to describe these circumstances. For instance, it frequently happens in business that the price per piece of a particular item is discounted once the quantity ordered exceeds a certain threshold.<br><br>
<b>Mortgage Payments:</b> <br>
The inputs are the principal sum, interest rate, and duration of the loan or investment.<br><br>

<h2>4.Quantification:</h2> <br>
 <img class="img1"style="border: 5px solid black;"src="C:\Users\91968\Desktop\maths webpage\therometer.jpeg" width="200px"/>
  <br><b>Temperature:</b> <br>Most thermometers have scales for both degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit. Children can use a thermometer to understand how input and output functions work.<br> <br>
<b>Weight:</b><br> The amount of force applied to weighing scales allows them to calculate the weight. They then translate the outcome into mass and present it in different mass units, such as kilograms or pounds. Children can comprehend the functions of the weighing machine in a manner similar to how a thermometer works.<br><br>
<b>Distance:</b> <br>The mileage of a car, the duration of a falling object, and the cost of a taxi ride are all functions of distance in various everyday situations.<br><br>
